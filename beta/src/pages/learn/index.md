## Creating and nesting components {/*components*/}

React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

```js
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>Click me</button>
  );
}
```

Now that you've declared `MyButton`, you can nest it into another component:

```js {5}
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice that `<MyButton />` starts with a capital letter. That's how you know it's a React component. React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

Have a look at the result:

<Sandpack>

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
function Greeting({name}) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
=======
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
>>>>>>> 5f0549c86e7a9c0774e66687d1bc0118a681eb9d
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

The `export default` keywords specify the main component in the file. If you're not familiar with some piece of JavaScript syntax, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) and [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/import-export) have great references.

## Writing markup with JSX {/*writing-markup-with-jsx*/}

The markup syntax you've seen above is called JSX. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its convenience. All of the [tools we recommend for local development](/learn/installation) support JSX out of the box.

JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like `<br />`. Your component also can't return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a `<div>...</div>` or an empty `<>...</>` wrapper:

### What can you do with React? {/*what-can-you-do-with-react*/}

Quite a lot, really! People use React to create all kinds of user interfaces--from small controls like buttons and dropdowns to entire apps. **These docs will teach you to use React on the web.** However, most of what you'll learn here applies equally for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) which lets you build apps for Android, iOS, and even [Windows and macOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/).

If you're curious which products you use everyday are built with React, you can install the [React Developer Tools](/learn/react-developer-tools). Whenever you visit an app or a website built with React (like this one!), its icon will light up in the toolbar.

### React uses JavaScript {/*react-uses-javascript*/}

With React, you will describe your visual logic in JavaScript. This takes some practice. If you're learning JavaScript and React at the same time, you're not alone--but at times, it will be a little bit more challenging! On the upside, **much of learning React is really learning JavaScript,** which means you will take your learnings far beyond React.

Check your knowledge level with [this JavaScript overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript). It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) are two great resources to use as a reference.

<DeepDive title="Installation (optional)">

If you're just starting to learn React, you don't need to install anything. Instead, we recommend to follow along using the interactive sandboxes that appear throughout this site. They look like this:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Greeting({name}) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <Greeting name="world" />;
}
```

</Sandpack>

When you're ready to start a project, there are several options. You can write React code online and save your work in an environment like [CodeSandbox](https://react.new/). You can add React as a `<script>` tag to any HTML file to try it for a small part of your existing webpage. Or you can create a whole new React app, with or without a framework. **Use the [Installation](/learn/installation) page to pick what works best for you--but you can skip it for now.**

</DeepDive>

## Learn React {/*learn-react*/}

There are a few ways to get started:

- If you're **feeling impatient and learn by example,** head straight to **[Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react)**. This tutorial doesn't explain the syntax in detail, but it will give you an idea of what it feels like to build user interfaces with React.
- If you're **familiar with the concepts and want to browse the available APIs**, check out **[the API reference](/reference)**.
- The rest of this documentation is organized in chapters that **introduce each concept step by step**--with many interactive examples, detailed explanations, and challenges to check your understanding. You don't have to read them sequentially, but each next page assumes you're familiar with concepts from the previous pages.

To save you time, we provide **a brief overview of each chapter** below.

### Chapter 1 overview: Describing the UI {/*chapter-1-overview-describing-the-ui*/}

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called ["components"](/learn/your-first-component). A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. Here, a _parent_ `Gallery` component renders three _child_ `Profile` components:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
      className="avatar"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img {
  margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
  height: 90px;
}
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

</Sandpack>

The markup in the example above looks a lot like HTML. This syntax is called [JSX](/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), and it is a bit stricter (for example, you have to close all the tags). Note that the CSS class is specified as `className` in JSX.

Just like you can pass some information to the browser `<img>` tag, you can also pass information to your own components like `<Profile>`. Such information is called [_props_](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component). Here, three `<Profile>`s receive different props:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Profile({name, imageUrl}) {
  return <img className="avatar" src={imageUrl} alt={name} />;
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile name="Lin Lanying" imageUrl="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg" />
      <Profile
        name="Gregorio Y. Zara"
        imageUrl="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      />
      <Profile name="Hedy Lamarr" imageUrl="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
img {
  margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
  height: 90px;
}
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

</Sandpack>

You might wonder why `className="avatar"` uses quotes but `src={imageUrl}` uses curly braces. In JSX, curly braces are like a ["window into JavaScript"](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces). They let you run a bit of JavaScript right in your markup! So `src={imageUrl}` reads the `imageUrl` prop declared on the first line and passed from the parent `Gallery` component.

In the above example, all the data was written directly in markup. However, you'll often want to keep it separately. Here, the data is kept in an array. In React, you use JavaScript functions like [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to [render lists](/learn/rendering-lists) of things.

<Sandpack>

```js App.js
import {people} from './data.js';
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      {people.map((person) => (
        <Profile key={person.id} name={person.name} imageId={person.imageId} />
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```js Profile.js
export default function Profile({name, imageId}) {
  const imageUrl = 'https://i.imgur.com/' + imageId + 's.jpg';
  return <img className="avatar" src={imageUrl} alt={name} />;
}
```

```js data.js
export const people = [
  {
    id: 0,
    name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
    imageId: 'MK3eW3A',
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
    imageId: 'mynHUSa',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
    imageId: 'bE7W1ji',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
    imageId: 'IOjWm71',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
    imageId: 'lrWQx8l',
  },
];
```

```css
img {
  margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
}
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

</Sandpack>

### Chapter 2 overview: Adding interactivity {/*chapter-2-overview-adding-interactivity*/}

Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” puts a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called [_state_](/learn/state-a-components-memory).

You can add state to a component with a [`useState`](/reference/usestate) Hook. Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (state is one of those features). The `useState` Hook lets you declare a state variable. It takes the initial state and returns a pair of values: the current state, and a state setter function that lets you update it.

This `Gallery` component needs to remember two things: the current image index (initially, `0`), and whether the user has toggled "Show details" (initially, `false`):

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);
```

Notice how clicking the buttons updates the screen:

<Sandpack>

```js
import {useState} from 'react';
import {sculptureList} from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>Next</button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i>
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img src={sculpture.url} alt={sculpture.alt} />
=======
```js {3,6}
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

If you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an [online converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx).

## Adding styles {/*adding-styles*/}

In React, you specify a CSS class with `className`. It works the same way as HTML [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) attribute:

```js
<img className="avatar" />
```

Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:

```css
/* In your CSS */
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

React does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you'll add a [`<link>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.

## Displaying data {/*displaying-data*/}

JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you "escape back" into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display `user.name`:

```js {3}
return (
  <h1>
    {user.name}
  </h1>
);
```

You can also "escape into JavaScript" from JSX attributes, but you have to use curlies *instead of* quotes. For example, `className="avatar"` passes the `"avatar"` string as the CSS class, but `src={user.imageUrl}` reads the JavaScript `user.imageUrl` variable value, and then passes that value as the `src` attribute:

```js {3,4}
return (
  <img
    className="avatar"
    src={user.imageUrl}
  />
);
```

You can put any dynamic expressions inside JSX curlies, including string concatenation and object literals:

<Sandpack>

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Hedy Lamarr',
  imageUrl: 'https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg',
  imageSize: 90,
};

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={user.imageUrl}
        alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}
        style={{
          width: user.imageSize,
          height: user.imageSize
        }}
      />
>>>>>>> 5f0549c86e7a9c0774e66687d1bc0118a681eb9d
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
h2 {
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
h3 {
  margin-top: 5px;
  font-weight: normal;
  font-size: 100%;
}
img {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
}
=======
```css
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
}

.large {
  border: 4px solid gold;
}
```

</Sandpack>

In the above example, `style={{ }}` is not a special syntax, but a regular object inside the JSX curlies. You can use the `style` attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.

## Conditional rendering {/*conditional-rendering*/}

In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, you'll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an [`if`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statement to conditionally include JSX:

```js
let content;
if (isLoggedIn) {
  content = <AdminPanel />;
} else {
  content = <LoginForm />;
}
return (
  <div>
    {content}
  </div>
);
```

If you prefer terser code, you can use the [conditional `?` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator). Unlike `if`, it works inside JSX:

```js
<div>
  {isLoggedIn ? (
    <AdminPanel />
  ) : (
    <LoginForm />
  )}
</div>
```

When you don't need the `else` branch, you can also use a shorter [logical `&&` syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND#short-circuit_evaluation):

```js
<div>
  {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
</div>
```

All of the same approaches work for conditionally specifying attributes. If you're unfamiliar with some of this JavaScript syntax, you can start by always using `if...else`.

## Rendering lists {/*rendering-lists*/}

You will rely on JavaScript features like [`for` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) and the [array `map()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to render lists of components.

For example, let's say you have an array of products:

```js
const products = [
  { title: 'Cabbage', id: 1 },
  { title: 'Garlic', id: 2 },
  { title: 'Apple', id: 3 },
];
```

Inside your component, use the `map()` function to transform an array of products into an array of `<li>` items:

```js
const listItems = products.map(product =>
  <li key={product.id}>
    {product.title}
  </li>
);

return (
  <ul>{listItems}</ul>
);
```

Notice how `<li>` has a `key` attribute. For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React will rely on your keys to understand what happened if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items.

<Sandpack>

```js
const products = [
  { title: 'Cabbage', isFruit: false, id: 1 },
  { title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 },
  { title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 },
];

export default function ShoppingList() {
  const listItems = products.map(product =>
    <li
      key={product.id}
      style={{
        color: product.isFruit ? 'magenta' : 'darkgreen'
      }}
    >
      {product.title}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

## Responding to events {/*responding-to-events*/}

You can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside your components:

```js {2-4,7}
function MyButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

Notice how `onClick={handleClick}` has no parentheses at the end! Do not _call_ the event handler function: you only need to *pass it down*. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.

## Updating the screen {/*updating-the-screen*/}

Often, you'll want your component to "remember" some information and display it. For example, maybe you want to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add *state* to your component.

First, import [`useState`](/reference/usestate) from React:

```js {1,4}
import { useState } from 'react';
```

Now you can declare a *state variable* inside your component:

```js
function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

You will get two things from `useState`: the current state (`count`), and the function that lets you update it (`setCount`). You can give them any names, but the convention is to call them like `[thing, setThing]`.

The first time the button is displayed, `count` will be `0` because you passed `0` to `useState()`. When you want to change state, call `setCount()` and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter:

```js {5}
function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

React will call your component function again. This time, `count` will be `1`. Then it will be `2`. And so on.

If you render the same component multiple times, each will get its own state. Try clicking each button separately:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
>>>>>>> 5f0549c86e7a9c0774e66687d1bc0118a681eb9d
button {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

Functions starting with `use` are called Hooks. `useState` is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the [React API reference](/reference). You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.

Hooks are more restrictive than regular functions. You can only call Hooks *at the top level* of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to `useState` in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

## Sharing data between components {/*sharing-data-between-components*/}

In the above example, each counter is independent. If you want them to display the same value and update together, *move the state up* to their closest common ancestor. First, move state from `MyButton` into `MyApp`:

```js {2,6-10}
function MyButton() {
  // ... we're moving code from here ...
}

export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then, *pass down* the state and the event handler that's now inside `MyApp` to `MyButton`. You can pass information to `MyButton` using the JSX curly braces, just like you previously did with built-in tags like `<img>`:

```js {11-13}
export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update together</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Finally, change `MyButton` to *read* the passed data from the parent component instead of using state:

```js {1,3}
function MyButton({ count, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

Information received from a parent component is called *props*. The parent `MyApp` component keeps `count` in its state and declares the `handleClick` event handler. It passes `count` and `handleClick` as props to each of the `MyButton` components. When a button is clicked, the state of `MyApp` changes, and React updates the screen.

This is called "lifting state up". By moving state up, we've shared it between components.

<Sandpack>

```js
import {useState} from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  });

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      firstName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      lastName: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      email: e.target.value,
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName} {person.lastName} ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update together</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />

You can also hold arrays in state. This lets you add, remove, or change things in a list in response to user interactions. Depending on what you want to do, there are [different ways to make new arrays from existing ones](/learn/updating-arrays-in-state).

<Sandpack>

```js
import {useState} from 'react';

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setName('');
          setArtists([...artists, {id: nextId++, name: name}]);
        }}>
        Add
      </button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map((artist) => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );

button {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;

}
```

### Chapter 3 overview: Managing state {/*chapter-3-overview-managing-state*/}

You'll often face a choice of _what exactly_ to put into state. Should you use one state variable or many? An object or an array? How should you [structure your state](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure)? The most important principle is to **avoid redundant state**. If some information never changes, it shouldn't be in state. If some information is received from parent by props, it shouldn't be in state. And if you can compute something from other props or state, it shouldn't be in state either!

For example, this form has a **redundant** `fullName` state variable:

<Sandpack>

```js
import {useState} from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
    setFullName(e.target.value + ' ' + lastName);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>
      <label>
        First name: <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name: <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can remove it and simplify the code by calculating `fullName` while the component is rendering:

<Sandpack>

```js
import {useState} from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Let’s check you in</h2>
      <label>
        First name: <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name: <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p>
        Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```css
label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}
```

</Sandpack>

This might seem like a small change, but many bugs in React apps are fixed this way!

Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as ["lifting state up"](/learn/sharing-state-between-components), and it's one of the most common things you will do writing React code. For example, in an accordion like below, only one panel should be active at a time. Instead of keeping the active state inside each individual panel, the parent component holds the state and specifies the props for its children.

<Sandpack>

```js
import {useState} from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}>
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
        city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}>
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for
        "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region
        surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and
        the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely
        candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({title, children, isActive, onShow}) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? <p>{children}</p> : <button onClick={onShow}>Show</button>}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```css
h3,
p {
  margin: 5px 0px;
}
.panel {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #aaa;
}
```
